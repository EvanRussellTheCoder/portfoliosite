  <p>I am a person trying to get a Bachelors in CS from the University of Rhode Island</p>
  <p> In my free time I like to hang out with friends, make music (produce beats specifically 🎧), exercise 🏋️‍♂️, code for fun 👨‍💻, study psychology 🧠, and learn just about anything 📖</p>
  <p>I don't exactly know yet what I'd like to specialize in. I think I just want to be a software engineer that can work on just about anything!</p>
