      <h2>Hey there, I guess you decided to want to actually get to know me as a human being. Well isn't that sweet of you? When you get bored of reading about me, <a href="index.html"> here's a link back to the first page</a>.</h2>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          I'm going to school for Computer Science, of course I should know
          how to code lol. I'd really like to eventually be one of those
          YouTubers who engage with other professional programmers one day to
          teach people how to solve coding interview problems.

        <h3>Beat Producing</h3>
        <p>
          I was always into rapping when I was a kid, I was always great at writing, and I liked making music! I wanted to be famous,
          then I found a different way in life by coding. Doesn't mean I gave
          up on music entirely, though. I don't plan to be famous, but I do
          like making music in my pass time, and finding a way to make money
          off beats and dabbling in song writing is a nice gig.

        <h3>Being Agile</h3>
        <p>
          I got introduced to what a scrum master was in my first year at
          university. I thought it was a cool job to literally help out other
          developers/engineers with making their lives easier as they worked.
          My experiences in life helped me gain some skills to help people
          effectively apply agile to their work.

          <h3>Guiding Fellow People With Learning Disabilities</h3>
          <p>
            I have a form of autism known as "Asperger's Syndrome". You might hear people say it means that someone is "wired differently", and I agree with that. But, when people ask me what that means, I say "I'm built different". Not to start a sentimental pity party, but growing up autistic was really strange and really tough, it comes with its own set of unique challenges. Don't even get me started on being an autistic college student in a pandemic lol. But, I love the person I turned into over the years, being "wired differently" allowed me to become "built different". It's why I have the mentality and foundation to become an excellent programmer and agilist. My school (The University of Rhode Island) gave me an opportunity to become a role model and guide to other students who have autism and other learning disabilities. I help other people achieve their full potential in life, and that drives me to be the best I can be everyday. Currently, I work with a program in Rhode Island called the Office of Rehabilitation Services to speak with incoming college students with disabilities, as well as their parents, to guide them in their journeys of higher education.

          <h3>That's everything that I can do as of now. I haven't even began to peak yet. There's tons of things I want to do, and will want to do. Here's some things I want to do next</h3>
          <p>
              For instance, I said I was always great at writing. So, I'd like to start a blog or get paid to write articles of some sort, given they'd be related to tech, beat making, agile, autism, or whatever else I can think of.
          </p>

              I grew up surrounded by a lot of people who weren't financially literate. I still wouldn't consider myself savvy when it comes to saving. But, I've had some fun here and there investing in stocks, and am interested in investing in real estate. I imagine myself doing something like making a home system for people who are low income, then linking them with job training programs to help them gain skills and get jobs to advance further in life. Wishful thinking? Maybe, but it could be possible, and I could help more people change their lives this way.

              Remember when I said I'd like to make a YT channel? I'd like to make it about anything related to my life that I can show other people. I'd like to teach other people how to do things, specifically about anything I like to do and am doing right now. The main things I'd like to do with a possible YT channel are educate people, make people laugh, and make people feel happy in general.
