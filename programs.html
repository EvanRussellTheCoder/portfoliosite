    <h1>Wanna know something I like to say to people?</h1>
    <p>In my eyes, everybody's a noob at coding lol</p>
    <p>You could be a college kid like me or a senior engineer. And you're STILL a noob with this stuff.</p>
    <p>Why? Because the tools we use are ALWAYS changing. We will never learn everything about coding! And that's why I love it!</p>
    <p>I also tell myself that everyone is a noob at this stuff to make me feel better when I dont understand something. It lets me sleep at night.</p>
    <h3>Now here's some projects:</h3>
    <h2 class="bb">Bad Bunny üê∞</h2>
    <p class="progp">Here's a demo of a game that me and a friend made with JS in one of my Computer science classes called Bad Bunny (Yes, like Bad Bunny the singer/rapper/songwriter/icon). We got a 100 on this project, so I guess it was good enough to put in the portfolio ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
    <p class="progp">Bad Bunny is a minigame, the object is to click the bunnies away from the carrot in the middle of the screen for as long as you can. Every 10 seconds of survival, the level goes up by one. Every time the level goes up, the speed of the bunnies and the number of bunnies that come after the carrot increases.</p>
    <p class="progp">Your score is the number of seconds you manage to survive. I left the beta down below in case you wanna give it a shot: </p>

    <p>(sadly you can't see the game just yet, I have to upload the python version that my friend and I have made)</p>
    <p class="progp">This was my first real project, actually. We built this in a 2 week period some time back in November 2019. I loved the vibes me and my homie bounced off each other while making this. We might work on making a phone app for this in the future ü§î We can definitely improve the graphics and maybe give some more background screens to choose from, bunny skins, carrot colors, etc.</p>
